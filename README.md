# Rock_Paper_Scissor_Game

This game is played by children and adults and is popular all over the world. Apart from being a game played to pass time, the game is usually played in situations where something has to be chosen. It is similar in that way to other games like flipping the coin, throwing dice or drawing straws. There is no room for cheating or for knowing what the other person is going to do so the results are usually very satisfying with no room for fighting or error.

The game is generally played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules:

-Rock wins against scissors.
-Scissors win against paper.
-Paper wins against rock.

Here in my application, the players select numbers 1, 2, 3 to select Rock, Paper and Scissor respectively to play the game. It's designed with 'best of three' game approach where a winner is selected based on 2 wins.
